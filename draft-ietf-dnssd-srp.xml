    <abstract>
      <t>The Service Registration Protocol (SRP) for DNS-based Service
        Discovery (DNS&nbhy;SD) uses the standard DNS Update mechanism to
        enable DNS&nbhy;SD using only unicast packets.  This makes it possible
        to deploy DNS&nbhy;SD without multicast, which greatly improves
        scalability and improves performance on networks where multicast
        service is not an optimal choice, particularly IEEE 802.11
        (Wi-Fi) and IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  DNS&nbhy;SD Service
        registration uses public keys and SIG(0) to allow services to defend
        their registrations.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
        DNS&nbhy;SD <xref target="RFC6763"/>
        is a component of Zero Configuration Networking
        <xref target="RFC6760"/>
        <xref target="ZC"/>
        <xref target="I-D.cheshire-dnssd-roadmap"/>.</t>
      <t>
        This document describes an enhancement to DNS&nbhy;SD that
	allows servers to register the services they offer using the DNS protocol
	over unicast rather than using Multicast DNS (mDNS) <xref target="RFC6762"/>.
	There is already a large installed base of DNS&nbhy;SD
	clients that can discover services using the DNS
	protocol (e.g., Android, Windows, Linux, Apple).</t>
      <t>
        This document is intended for three audiences: implementers of software that provides services that should be advertised
        using DNS&nbhy;SD, implementers of authoritative DNS servers that will
        be used in contexts where DNS&nbhy;SD registration is needed, and
        administrators of networks where DNS&nbhy;SD service is required.
        The document is expected to provide sufficient
        information to allow interoperable implementation of the registration protocol.</t>
	<t>

<!--[rfced] Should "services" be "servers" here to match previous,
     similar text?  And perhaps avoiding the two "provide" uses so
     close together would be helpful for the reader?

Original:
   DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) allows services to advertise
   the fact that they provide service, and to provide the
   information required to access that service.

Perhaps:
   DNS-SD allows servers to advertise the fact that they provide
   service and to share the information required to access that
   service.

[Ted]

The term "server" would be confusing here. We really do mean services. That's what is discovered
using service discovery. I've reworded the sentence to make this (I hope!) clearer.

A server is the thing that provides the service. So servers register services, or more correctly the SRP requester registers a service on behalf of a server.
Another point of confusion is "server" versus "DNS server" so I've clarified that
throughout by replacing "server" with "authoritative DNS server" when it's a DNS server and
not a server publishing a service.

-->

        DNS&nbhy;SD allows servers to publish
        the information required to access the services they provide.
        DNS&nbhy;SD clients can then discover the set of services of a particular
        type that are available.  They can then select a service from among those that are available and obtain the information
        required to use it.  Although DNS&nbhy;SD using the DNS protocol
        can be more efficient and versatile than using mDNS, it is
        not common in practice because of the difficulties associated with updating authoritative DNS services with service
        information.</t>

      <t>
	The existing practice for updating DNS zones is either to enter new data manually or to use DNS Update
      <xref target="RFC2136"/>. Unfortunately, DNS Update requires either:</t>
      <ul>
	<li>that the authoritative DNS server automatically trust
	updates or</li>
	<li>that the DNS Update requester have some kind of shared secret
	or public key that is known to the authoritative DNS server
	and can be used to authenticate the update.</li></ul>
	<t>Furthermore, DNS Update can be a fairly chatty process, requiring multiple
	roundtrips with different conditional predicates to complete the update process.</t>

<!-- [Ted] conditional predicates are a thing in DNS Update. It's not that there are
     predicates that are conditional on the use of DNS update. So putting a '-' here
     changes the meaning in a particularly confusing way. I think saying DNS Update
     here is actually redundant anyway, and the sentence is clearer without it. -->

      <t>
	The Service Registration Protocol (SRP) adds a set of default
	heuristics for processing DNS updates that eliminates the need for
	conditional predicates.
	Instead, the SRP registrar (an authoritative DNS server
	that supports SRP Updates) has a set of default predicates
	that are applied to the update; and the update either succeeds entirely or fails in a way that allows the requester to know
	what went wrong and construct a new update.</t>

      <t>
	SRP also adds a feature called "First Come, First Served Naming" (or "FCFS Naming"), which allows the requester to:</t>
	<ul><li>claim a name that is
	not yet in use, and</li>

<!-- [Ted] I note that you use SIG(0) ([RFC2931]) here, but that elsewhere you use e.g. DNS Update (see [RFC2136]). I'm all for
     consistency, but I think this usage is clunky. It used to be the norm to just say e.g. DNS Update [RFC2136]. I think this
     is clearer and easier to read. Certainly there is no need for the parentheses if you don't use 'see'. But in any case, if
     (see [RFCblah]) is the new house style, it should be used consistently. Please either get rid of "(see ...)" and "(...)" in
     these references, or choose "(see ...)". As I move through the document I'm seeing more of these gratuitous parentheses,
     which definitely isn't an improvement. -->

	<li>using SIG(0) <xref target="RFC2931"/>,
	authenticate both the initial claim
	(to ensure it has not been modified in transit)
	and subsequent updates
	(to ensure they come from the same entity that performed the initial claim).</li></ul>

<!-- [Ted] I don't understand this edit. I admit that the original sentence could be a bit unclear, but the new sentence seems
     less clear. I have proposed a fix here: -->
	<t>This prevents a new service instance from "stealing" a name that is already in use:
	a second SRP requester attempting to claim an existing name will not possess the
	SIG(0) key used by the first requester to claim it. Because of this, its claim will be rejected. This will force it to
	choose a new name.</t>

      <t>
	It is important to understand that "authenticate" here just means that we can tell that an update came from the same source
	as the original registration. We have not established trust. This has important implications for what we can and can't do
	with data the SRP requester sends us.
	You will notice as you read this document that
	we only support adding a very restricted set
	of records, and the content of those records is further constrained.</t>

      <t>
	The reason for this is precisely that we have not established trust. So, we can only publish information that we feel safe in
	publishing even though we do not have any basis for trusting the requester.
	We reason that mDNS <xref target="RFC6762"/> allows
	arbitrary hosts on a single IP link to advertise services
	<xref target="RFC6763"/>, relying on whatever service is
	advertised to provide authentication as a part of its protocol rather than in the service advertisement.</t>

      <t>
	This is considered reasonably safe because it requires physical presence on the network in order to advertise. An off-network
	mDNS attack is simply not possible. Our goal with this specification is to impose similar constraints. Therefore, you will
	see in <xref target="add_validation"/> that a very restricted set of records with a very restricted set of relationships are
	allowed. You will also see in <xref target="source_validation"/> that we give advice on how to prevent off-network attacks.</t>

      <t>
	This leads us to the disappointing observation that this protocol is not a mechanism for adding arbitrary information to
	DNS zones. We have not evaluated the security properties of adding, for example, an SOA record, an MX record, or a CNAME
	record; therefore, these are forbidden.
	Future updates to this specification might include analyses for other records
	and extend the set of records and/or record content that can be registered here.
	Or it might require establishment of trust, and add an authorization model
	to the authentication model we now have.
	But that is work for a future document.</t>

      <t>
	Finally, SRP adds the concept of a "lease" <xref target="RFC9664"/>,
	analogous to leases in DHCP
	<xref target="RFC2131"/><xref target="RFC8415"/>.
	The SRP registration itself has a lease that
	may be on the order of two hours; if the requester
	does not renew the lease before it has elapsed, the registration is removed.  The claim on the name can have a longer
	lease so that another requester cannot claim the name, even though the registration has expired.</t>

<!-- [Ted] This edit makes the sentence not make sense. What is "The SRP for DNS-SD?"  I don't know. This is not a good time to use
     an acronym. We could say "SRP provides a..." but for whatever reason we wanted to spell out the protocol that is described
     in this document, so I think we need to fully spell it out. -->

      <t>
        The Service Registration Protocol for DNS&nbhy;SD
        specified in this document provides a reasonably secure
        mechanism for publishing this information.
        Once published, these services can be readily
        discovered by DNS&nbhy;SD clients using
        standard DNS lookups.</t>
<!-- [Ted] The original text was unclear, but the change unfortunately guesses wrong as to the meaning and makes it even less clear. How about: -->
      <t>
        Section 10 of the DNS&nbhy;SD specification <xref target="RFC6763"/>
        briefly discusses ways that servers can advertise the services
        they provide in the DNS namespace.  In the case of
        mDNS, it allows servers to advertise their services on the local link, using names in the ".local" namespace, which makes
        their services directly discoverable by peers attached to that same local link.</t>
<!-- [Ted] Adding a dependent clause here obscures the meaning of the second half of the compound sentence. -->
      <t>
        DNS&nbhy;SD <xref target="RFC6763"/> also allows clients to discover services
        using the DNS protocol over traditional unicast <xref target="RFC1035"/>.
        This can be done by
        having a system administrator manually configure service information in the DNS; however, manually populating DNS authoritative
        server databases is costly and potentially error-prone and requires a knowledgeable network administrator.  Consequently,
        although all DNS&nbhy;SD client implementations of which we are
        aware support DNS&nbhy;SD using DNS queries, in practice it
        is used much less frequently than mDNS.</t>
      <t>
<!-- [Ted] removing the commas here changes the meaning. We're expressing two different reasons, not one complicated reason. This is referring to the
     first removal of commas; the second is a huge improvement! -->
        The Discovery Proxy <xref target="RFC8766"/> provides one way to automatically populate the DNS
        namespace but is only appropriate on networks where services are easily advertised using mDNS.  The present document describes a
        solution more suitable for networks where multicast is inefficient,
        or where sleepy devices are common, by supporting use of unicast
        for both the offering of services and the discovery of services.</t>

      <name>Service Registration Protocol</name>
      <t>
        Services that implement SRP use DNS Update <xref target="RFC2136"/> with SIG(0) <xref target="RFC3007"/> to publish service information
        in the DNS.  Two variants exist: one for full-featured hosts and one for devices designed for Constrained-Node Networks (CNNs)
        <xref target="RFC7228"/>.
        An SRP registrar is most likely an authoritative DNS server,
        or is a source of data for one or more authoritative DNS servers.
        There is no requirement that the authoritative DNS server that is
        receiving SRP Updates be the same authoritative DNS server that is
        answering queries that return records that have been registered.
        For example, an SRP registrar could be the "hidden primary" that is
        the source of data for a fleet of secondary authoritative DNS servers.</t>
      <section>
	<name>Protocol Variants</name>
	<section>
	  <name>Full-Featured Hosts</name>
	  <t>
            Full-featured hosts either are configured manually with a registration domain or discover the default registration
	    domain automatically using the Domain Enumeration process described in
	    Section <xref target="RFC6763" section="11" sectionFormat="bare"/>
	    of the DNS&nbhy;SD specification <xref target="RFC6763"/>.
	    If this process does not produce a
	    default registration domain, the SRP registrar
	    is not discoverable on the local network using this
	    mechanism. Other discovery mechanisms are possible, but they are out of scope for this document.</t>
	  <t>
            Configuration of the registration domain can be done either:</t>
	    <ul><li>by querying the list of available registration
            domains ("r._dns&nbhy;sd._udp") and allowing the user to select one from the UI or</li>
	    <li>by any other means appropriate to
            the particular use case being addressed.</li></ul>
	    <t>Full-featured devices construct the names of the SRV, TXT, and PTR records
            describing their service or services as subdomains of the chosen service registration domain.  For these names, they then discover
            the zone apex of the closest enclosing DNS zone using SOA queries
            as described in
            Section <xref target="RFC8765" section="6.1" sectionFormat="bare"/>
            of the DNS Push Notification specification <xref target="RFC8765"/>.
            Having
            discovered the enclosing DNS zone, they query for the "_dnssd&nbhy;srp._tcp.&lt;zone&gt;" SRV record to discover the
            SRP registrar to which they can send SRP Updates.  Hosts that support SRP Updates using TLS use the
            "_dnssd&nbhy;srp&nbhy;tls._tcp.&lt;zone&gt;" SRV record instead.</t>
	  <t>
	    Examples of full-featured hosts include devices such as home computers, laptops, powered peripherals with network
	    connections (such as printers and home routers), and even battery-operated devices such as mobile phones that have
	    long battery lives.
	  </t>
	</section>
	<section>
	  <name>Constrained Hosts</name>
	  <t>
            For devices designed for CNNs <xref target="RFC7228"/>,
            some simplifications are available.  Instead of
            being configured with (or discovering) the service registration domain,
            the special-use domain name <xref target="RFC6761"/> "default.service.arpa" is used.
            The details of how SRP registrars are discovered will be specific
            to the constrained network; therefore, we do not suggest a specific mechanism here.</t>
	  <t>
            SRP requesters on CNNs are expected to receive, from the network, a list of SRP registrars with which to register.
            It is the responsibility of a CNN supporting SRP to provide one or more registrar addresses.  It is
            the responsibility of the registrar supporting a CNN to handle the updates appropriately.  In some
            network environments, updates may be accepted directly into a local "default.service.arpa" zone, which has only local
            visibility.  In other network environments, updates for names ending in "default.service.arpa" may be rewritten by the registrar
            to names with broader visibility <xref target="RFC8766"/>.</t>
	</section>
	<section>
	  <name>Why two variants?</name>
	  <t>
            The reason for these different variants is that low-power devices that typically use CNNs may have
            very limited battery capacity.  The series of DNS lookups required to discover an SRP registrar and then communicate with
            it will increase the energy required to advertise a service; for low-power devices, the additional flexibility this
            provides does not justify the additional use of energy.  It is also fairly typical of such networks that some network
            service information is obtained as part of the process of joining the network; thus, this can be relied upon to provide
            nodes with the information they need.</t>
	  <t>
            Networks that are not CNNs can have more complicated topologies at the IP layer. Nodes connected
            to such networks can be assumed to be able to do DNS&nbhy;SD
            service registration domain discovery. Such networks are
            generally able to provide registration domain discovery and routing.  This creates the possibility of off-network
	    spoofing, where a device from a foreign network registers a service on the local network in order to attack devices
	    on the local network. To prevent such spoofing, TCP is required for such networks.

	<section anchor="what">
	  <name>What to Publish</name>
          <t>
            SRP Updates are sent by SRP requesters to SRP registrars.  Three types of instructions appear in an SRP Update: Service
	    Discovery instructions, Service Description instructions, and Host Description instructions. These instructions are made
	    up of DNS Update Resource Records (RRs) that are either adds or deletes. The types of records that are added, updated, and removed in each
	    of these instructions, as well as the constraints that apply to them, are described in <xref target="server_behavior"/>.
	    An SRP Update is a DNS Update message <xref target="RFC2136"/> that is
	    constructed so as to meet the constraints described in that section. The
	    following is a brief overview of what is included in a typical SRP Update:
	  </t>
          <ul spacing="normal">

            <li>
              PTR RR(s) for service(s), which map from a
              generic service type (or subtype(s)) to a specific
              Service Instance Name <xref target="RFC6763"/>.</li>
            <li>
	      For each Service Instance Name, an SRV RR, one or more
	      TXT RRs, and a KEY RR. Although, in principle, DNS&nbhy;SD
	      Service Description records can include other record types with
	      the same Service Instance Name, in practice, they rarely do.
	      Currently SRP does not permit other record types. The KEY RR is used
	      to support FCFS Naming and has no specific meaning for DNS&nbhy;SD
	      lookups. SRV records for all services described in an
	      SRP Update point to the same hostname.</li>
            <li>
	      There is always exactly one hostname in a single SRP Update.
              A DNS Update containing more than one hostname is not an SRP Update.
              The hostname has one or more address RRs (AAAA or A) and
              a KEY RR (used for FCFS Naming). Depending on the use case, an SRP requester may be required to suppress some
              addresses that would not be usable by hosts discovering the service through the SRP registrar. The exact address
              record suppression behavior required may vary for different types of SRP requesters.
              Guidance for suppressing unusable records can be found in
              Section <xref target="RFC8766" section="5.5.2" sectionFormat="bare"/>
              of the Discovery Proxy specification <xref target="RFC8766"/>.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
<!-- [Ted] An RRtype is a type of RR, not a type of RRs, so the plural there doesn't make sense. I've tweaked the sentence so that
     the confusion is eliminated (I hope). -->

          <t>
            The DNS-Based Service Discovery specification
            <xref target="RFC6763"/> describes the details of
            what each of these RR types mean, with the exception of
            the KEY RR, which was defined in the
            specification for how to store Diffie-Hellman
            Keys in the DNS <xref target="RFC2539"/>.
            These specifications should be considered
            the definitive sources for
            information about what to publish; the reason for summarizing this here is to provide the reader with enough information
            about what will be published that the service registration process can be understood at a high level without first
            learning the full details of DNS&nbhy;SD.

            Multicast DNS (mDNS) uses a single namespace, ".local". Subdomains of ".local" are specific to the local link on which they are advertised.  This convenience is not available for

          <t>
            It is possible to send a DNS Update message that does several things at once:
            for example, it's possible in a single transaction
            to add or update a single Host Description
            while also adding or updating the RRs comprising the Service Description(s)
            for one or more service instance(s) available on that host,
            and adding or updating the RRs comprising the Service Discovery instruction(s)
            for those service instance(s).</t>
          <t>
            An SRP Update takes advantage of this: it is implemented as a single DNS Update message that contains a service's Service
            Discovery records, Service Description records, and Host Description records.</t>
          <t>
            Updates done according to this specification
            are somewhat different from normal DNS Updates
	    <xref target="RFC2136"/> where the update process could involve many update attempts. You might first
	    attempt to add a name if it doesn't exist; if that fails, then in a second message you might update the name if it does
	    exist but matches certain preconditions.  Because the registration protocol described in this document uses a single transaction, some of this
	    adaptability is lost.</t>
          <t>
            In order to allow updates to happen in a single transaction, SRP Updates do not include update prerequisites.  The
            requirements specified in <xref target="server_behavior"/> are implicit in the processing of SRP Updates; thus, there is
            no need for the SRP requester to put in any explicit prerequisites.</t>

	    <t>SRP does not require that every update contain the same information.
	      When an SRP requester needs to send more than one
	      SRP Update to the SRP registrar, it SHOULD combine
	      these into a single SRP Update,
	      when possible, subject to DNS message size limits and link-specific
          size limits (e.g. an 802.15.4 network will perform poorly when asked
          to deliver a packet larger than about 500 bytes).
	      If the updates do not fit into a single SRP Update
	      then the SRP requester <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
	      send subsequent SRP Update sequentially:
	      until an earlier SRP Update has been acknowledged,
	      the requester <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
	      send any subsequent SRP Update.
	      If a configuration change occurs while an outstanding
	      SRP Update is in flight, the SRP registrar

            This approach uses a secret key shared between

              FCFS Naming provides a limited degree of security. A server that registers its service using SRP
              is given ownership of a name for an extended period of time based on a lease
              specific to the key used to authenticate the SRP Update, which may be longer than the lease associated with the
              registered RRs.  As long as the registrar remembers the name and
              does not reveal the key used to register RRs on that name,
              no other SRP requester can add or update the
              information associated with that name.
              If the SRP requester fails to renew its
              service registration before the KEY lease expires
              (Section <xref target="RFC9664" section="4" sectionFormat="bare"/>
              of the DNS Update Lease specification <xref target="RFC9664"/>)
              its name is no longer protected.
              FCFS Naming is used to protect both the Service Description
              and the Host Description.</t>

	  <name>SRP Requester Behavior</name>
	  <section>
	    <name>Public/Private Key Pair Generation and Storage</name>
            <t>
	      The requester generates a public/private key pair (<xref target="rsa"/>).
	      This key pair <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be stored in stable
	      storage; if there is no writable stable storage on the SRP requester, the SRP requester <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be preconfigured with a
	      public/private key pair in read-only storage.
	      This key pair <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be unique to the device.
	      A device
	      with rewritable storage <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> retain this key indefinitely.  When the device changes ownership, it may be appropriate
	      for the former owner to erase the old key pair, which would then require the new owner to install a new
              one. Therefore, the SRP requester on the device <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> provide a mechanism to erase the key (for example, as the
              result of a "factory reset") and to generate a new key.</t>
	    <t>
	      Note that when a new key is generated, this will prevent the device from registering with the name associated with the old key in the
	      same domain where it had previously registered. So implicit in the generation of a new key is the generation of a new name; this can
	      either be done proactively when regenerating a key, or can be done when the SRP update produces a name conflict.
            </t>
	    <t>
	      The policy described here for managing keys assumes that the keys are only used for SRP. If a key that is used for SRP
	      is also used for other purposes, the policy described here is likely to be insufficient. The policy stated here is <bcp14>NOT
	      RECOMMENDED</bcp14> in such a situation: a policy appropriate to the full set of uses for the key must be chosen. Specifying
	      such a policy is out of scope for this document.</t>
            <t>
	      When sending DNS updates, the requester includes a KEY record containing the public portion of the key in each Host
	      Description Instruction and each Service Description Instruction.  Each KEY record <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the same public key.
	      The update is signed using SIG(0), using the private key that corresponds to the public key in the KEY record.  The
	      lifetimes of the records in the update are
	      set using the EDNS(0) Update Lease option
	      <xref target="RFC9664"/>.</t>
	    <t>
	      The format of the KEY resource record in the SRP Update is
	      defined in the IETF specification for DNSSEC Resource Records
	      <xref target="RFC4034"/>. Because the KEY RR
	      used in SIG(0) is not a zone-signing key, the flags field in the KEY RR <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be all zeroes.</t>
            <t>
	      The KEY record in Service Description updates <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be omitted for brevity; if it is omitted, the SRP registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> behave
	      as if the same KEY record that is given for the Host Description is also given for each Service Description for which
	      no KEY record is provided.  Omitted KEY records are not used when computing the SIG(0) signature.</t>

	    <name>Name Conflict Handling</name>
	    <t>
	      "Add" operations for both Host Description RRs and
	      Service Description RRs can have names that result in name conflicts.
	      Service Discovery record "Add" operations
	      cannot have name conflicts.
	      If any Host Description or Service Description record
	      is found by the SRP registrar to have a conflict with an existing name, the registrar will respond to the SRP Update
	      with a YXDomain RCODE <xref target="RFC2136"/>. In this case, the
	      SRP requester <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> choose a new name or give up.</t>
	    <t>
	      There is no specific requirement for how the SRP
	      requester should choose a new name. Typically,
	      however, the requester will append a number to the
	      preferred name. This number could be sequentially increasing or could be chosen randomly. One existing implementation
	      attempts several sequential numbers before choosing randomly. For instance, it might try host.default.service.arpa,
	      then host-1.default.service.arpa, then host-2.default.service.arpa, then host-31773.default.service.arpa.</t>

	    <t>
	      The lifetime of the DNS&nbhy;SD PTR, SRV, A, AAAA, and TXT
	      records <xref target="RFC6763"/> uses the LEASE field
	      of the Update Lease option and is typically set to two hours.  Thus, if a device is disconnected from the
	      network, it does not continue to appear for too long in the
	      user interfaces of devices looking for instances of that service type.</t>
	    <t>
	      The lifetime of the KEY records is set using the KEY-LEASE field of the Update Lease Option and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be set to a
	      much longer time, typically 14 days.  The result being that even though a device may be temporarily unplugged --
	      disappearing from the network for a few days -- it makes a claim on its name that lasts much longer.</t>
	    <t>
	      Therefore, even if a device is unplugged from the network for a few days, and its services are not available for
	      that time, no other device can come along and claim its name the moment it disappears from the network.  In the event
	      that a device is unplugged from the network and permanently discarded, then its name is eventually cleaned up and made

	    <name>Compression in SRV Records</name>
	    <t>
	      Although the original SRV specification <xref target="RFC2782"/>
	      requires that the target hostname in the rdata of an SRV record
	      not be compressed in DNS queries and responses, an SRP requester
	      <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> compress the target in the SRV record,
	      since an SRP Update is neither a DNS query nor a DNS response.
	      The motivation for <em>not</em> compressing
	      is not stated in the SRV specification,
	      but is assumed to be because a recursive resolver
	      (caching server) that does not understand the format of the
	      SRV record might store it as binary data without decoding a
	      compression pointer embedded with the target hostname field,
	      and thus return nonsensical rdata in response to a query.
	      This concern does not apply in the
	      case of SRP. An SRP registrar needs to understand SRV records in order to validate the SRP Update. Compression of the
	      target can save space in the SRP Update,
	      so we want SRP requesters to be able to
	      assume that the registrar will handle
	      this. Therefore, SRP registrars <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support compression of SRV RR targets.</t>

	      <name>Removing Some Published Services</name>
	      <t>
		In some use cases, a requester may need to remove a
		specific service without removing its other services.
		For example, a device may
		shut down its remote screen access (_rfb._tcp) service
		while retaining its command-line login (_ssh._tcp) service.
		This can be accomplished in one of two ways:</t>
<ol><li>To simply remove a specific service, the requester sends a
		valid SRP Update with a
		Service Description Instruction (<xref target="servdesc"/>)
		containing a single "Delete All RRsets From A Name" update
		to the Service Instance Name.
		The SRP Update SHOULD include
		Service Discovery Instructions (<xref target="servdis"/>)
		consisting of "Delete An RR From An RRset" updates <xref target="RFC2136"/>
		that delete any PTR records whose target is
		the Service Instance Name.
		However, even in the absence of such Service Discovery Instructions,
		the SRP registrar MUST delete any Service Discovery PTR records
		that point to the deleted Service Instance Name.
		</li>
<!-- [Ted] Edit is good, but inconsistent use of "update" -->
	      <li>
		When deleting one service instance while simultaneously creating
		a new service instance with a different service instance name,
		an alternative is to perform both operations using a single SRP Update.
		In this case, the old service is deleted as in the first alternative.
		The new service is added, just
		as it would be in an update that wasn't deleting the old service. Because both the removal of the old service and
		the add of the new service consist of a valid Service Discovery Instruction and a valid Service Description
		Instruction, the update as a whole is a valid SRP Update and will result in the old service being removed and the
		new one added; or, to put it differently, the SRP Update will result in the old service being replaced by the new service.
	      </li></ol>
<!-- [Ted] Not sure this change was needed, but it's the SRP Update that will look similar, and while situation could mean that, I think it's confusing. -->
	      <t>
		It is perhaps worth noting that, if a service is being updated without
		the Service Instance Name changing (for example, when only the target
		port in the SRV record is being updated), that SRP Update will
		look very much like the second alternative above.
		The PTR record in the Service Discovery Instruction will be the same for
		both the "Delete An RR From An RRset" update and the "Add To An RRset" update
		<xref target="RFC2136"/>.
		Since the removal of the old service and the addition
		of the new service are both valid SRP Update operations,
		the combined operation is a valid SRP Update operation.
		The SRP registrar does not need to include code to
		recognize this special case, and does not need to
		take any special actions to handle it correctly.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Whichever of these two alternatives is used, the hostname lease
		will be updated with the lease time provided in the SRP update.
		In neither of these cases is it permissible to delete the hostname.
		All services must point to a hostname. If a hostname
		is to be deleted, this must be done using the method
		described in <xref target="zero-lease"/>, which deletes the
		hostname and all services that have that hostname as their target.

Current:
   An instruction is a Service Discovery Instruction if it:

   *  Contains exactly one "Add to an RRSet" (Section 2.5.1 of
      [RFC2136]) or exactly one "Delete an RR from an RRSet"
      (Section 2.5.4 of [RFC2136]) RR update, which updates a PTR RR;
      the target of which is a Service Instance Name for which name a
      Service Description Instruction is present in the SRP Update.
      Additionally:

      -  If the RR Update is an "Add to an RRSet" instruction, that
         Service Description Instruction contains an "Add to an RRset"
         RR update for the SRV RR describing that service and no other
         "Delete from an RRset" instructions for that Service Instance
         Name.
      -  If the RR Update is a "Delete an RR from an RRSet" instruction,
         that Service Description Instruction contains a "Delete from an
         RRset" RR update and no other "Add to an RRset" instructions
         for that Service Instance Name.

   *  Contains no other add or delete RR updates for the same name as
      the PTR RR Update.

[Ted] The working group worked very hard on the text and the organization and structure of the
      bullets here, and this change completely goes against that consensus, so I am reverting it. I
      don't mean to suggest that there was no point to this change, but it was really hard to get
      agreement on this precise way of formatting the text, and I do not want to repeat that process.
      I actually tried to replicate some of your changes, and wasn't sure if I was changing the
      meaning of the text, so I've only retained your capitalization changes. Please think of this
      text as more like computer code than human language, if that helps.

	    A DNS Update message that contains any additional

	  <t>An SRP Update <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include an EDNS(0) Update Lease option

	    The LEASE time specified in the Update Lease

          <t>
	    Assuming that the SRP registrar has confirmed that a DNS Update message
	    is a valid SRP Update (<xref target="validation"/>), it
	    then checks that the name in the Host Description Instruction exists in the zone being updated.  If so, then the registrar checks to see if the KEY
	    record on that name is the same as the KEY record in the Host Description Instruction.  The registrar performs the same
	    check for the KEY records in any Service Description Instructions.  For KEY records that were omitted from Service
	    Description Instructions, the KEY from the Host Description Instruction is used.  If any existing KEY record
	    corresponding to a KEY record in the SRP Update does not match the KEY record in the SRP Update (whether provided
	    or taken from the Host Description Instruction), then the SRP registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reject the SRP Update with the YXDomain

Original:
   Otherwise, the SRP registrar validates the SRP Update using SIG(0)
   against the public key in the KEY record of the Host Description
   Instruction.

Perhaps:
   If the above steps are not taken, the SRP registrar validates the

[Ted] Hm, not easy. See edit below.

          <t>
	    If the SRP Update is not in conflict with existing data in the zone being updated, the SRP registrar validates the SRP Update using SIG(0) against the public key in the KEY record of the Host

	    the SRP Update is malformed and the registrar
	    <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reject the SRP Update with the Refused RCODE.

<!-- [Ted] The comma after KEY RR was changed to a colon, and I can't see why. How about: -->
          <t>
	    KEY record updates omitted from Service Description Instruction(s) are processed as if they had been explicitly present.
	    After the SRP Update has been applied, every Service Description that is updated <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have a KEY RR, which <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have the

	    SRP requesters implementing this version of the SRP specification

	    SRP registrars implementing this version of the SRP specification

	  <name>Handling of Service Subtypes</name>
	  <t>
	    SRP registrars <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> treat the update instructions for a service type and all its subtypes as atomic. That is, when a
	    service and its subtypes are being updated, whatever information appears in the SRP Update is the entirety of
	    information about that service and its subtypes. If any subtype appeared in a previous update but does not appear in
	    the current update, then the SRP registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> remove that subtype.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    There is intentionally no mechanism for deleting a single subtype
	    individually. A delete of a service deletes all of its subtypes.
	    To delete a single subtype individually, an SRP Update must
	    be constructed that contains the service type and all subtypes

	  <name>SRP Update Response</name>
          <t>
	    The status that is returned depends on the result of processing the update and can be either NoError, ServFail, Refused,
	    or YXDomain. All other possible outcomes will already have been accounted for when applying the constraints that
	    qualify the update as an SRP Update. The meanings of these responses are explained in
	    Section <xref target="RFC2136" section="2.2" sectionFormat="bare"/>
	    of the DNS Update specification <xref target="RFC2136"/>.</t>
	  <t>
	    In the case of a response other than NoError,
	    Section <xref target="RFC2136" section="3.8" sectionFormat="bare"/>
	    of the DNS Update specification <xref target="RFC2136"/>
	    states that
	    the authoritative DNS server is permitted
            to respond either with no RRs or to copy the RRs
            sent by the DNS Update client into the response.
            The SRP requester <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> attempt
	    to validate any RRs that are included in the response. It is possible that a future SRP extension may include per-RR
	    indications as to why the update failed, but
	    at the time of writing this is not specified.
	    So, if an SRP requester were to attempt to validate
            the RRs in the response, it might reject such a response since it would contain RRs but probably not a set of RRs
	    identical to what was sent in the SRP Update.</t>

     isn't the example, so the extra comma changes the meaning. -->
          <t>
	    The SRP registrar <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> add a Reverse Mapping
	    (described for IPv4 in
	    Section <xref target="RFC1035" section="3.5" sectionFormat="bare"/>
	    of the DNS specification <xref target="RFC1035"/>
	    and for IPv6 in
	    Section <xref target="RFC3596" section="2.5" sectionFormat="bare"/>
	    of the later document updating DNS for IPv6 <xref target="RFC3596"/>)
	    that corresponds to the Host Description.
	    This is optional because the reverse mapping
	    serves no essential protocol function,
	    but it may be useful for debugging, for example in annotating network packet traces or logs.  In order for the registrar to do
	    a reverse mapping update, it must be authoritative for the zone that would need to be updated or have credentials to do
	    the update.  The SRP requester <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also do a reverse mapping update if it has credentials to do so.</t>
          <t>
	    The SRP registrar <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> apply additional criteria when accepting updates.  In some networks, it may be possible to do
	    out-of-band registration of keys and only accept updates from preregistered keys.  In this case, an update for a key
	    that has not been registered <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be rejected with the Refused RCODE.
	    When use of managed keys is desired,
	    there are at least two benefits to doing this in conjunction with SRP
	    rather than simply performing traditional DNS Updates using SIG(0) keys:</t>
	  <ol><li>The same
	    over-the-air registration protocol is used in both cases,
	    so both use cases can be addressed by the same SRP requester
	    implementation.</li>
	    <li>The registration protocol includes maintenance functionality not present with normal DNS
	    updates.</li></ol>
          <t>
	    Note that the semantics of using SRP in this way
	    are different from the semantics of typical
	    implementations of DNS Update. The KEY used
	    to sign the SRP Update only allows the SRP requester to update records that refer to its Host Description.
	    Implementations of traditional DNS Update
	    <xref target="RFC2136"/> do not normally provide
	    a way to enforce a constraint of this type.</t>
          <t>
	    The SRP registrar could also have a dictionary of names or name patterns that are not permitted.  If such a list is used,
	    updates for Service Instance Names that match entries in the dictionary are rejected with a Refused RCODE.</t>

      <name>TTL Consistency</name>
      <t>
	All RRs within an RRset are required to have the same TTL
	(required by
	Section <xref target="RFC2181" section="5.2" sectionFormat="bare"/>
	of the DNS Clarifications document <xref target="RFC2181"/>).
	In order to avoid inconsistencies, SRP places restrictions on TTLs sent by requesters and requires that SRP registrars enforce
	consistency.</t>
      <t>
	Requesters sending SRP Updates <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use consistent
	TTLs in all RRs within each RRset contained within an SRP Update.</t>
      <t>
	SRP registrars <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> check that the TTLs for all RRs
	within each RRset contained within an SRP Update are the same.
	If they are not, the SRP
	update <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be rejected with a Refused RCODE.</t>
      <t>
	Additionally, when adding RRs to an RRset (for example, when processing Service Discovery records), the SRP registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use the
	same TTL on all RRs in the RRset.  How this consistency is enforced is up to the implementation.</t>
      <t>
	TTLs sent in SRP Updates are advisory: they indicate the SRP requester's guess as to what a good TTL would be.  SRP registrars may
	override these TTLs.  SRP registrars <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> ensure that TTLs are reasonable: neither too long nor too short.  The TTL <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14>
	ever be longer than the lease time (<xref target="stale"/>).  Shorter TTLs will result in more frequent data refreshes;
	this increases latency on the DNS&nbhy;SD client side, increases
	load on any caching resolvers and on the authoritative DNS server,
	and also increases network load, which may be an issue for CNNs.  Longer TTLs will increase the likelihood
	that data in caches will be stale.  TTL minimums and maximums <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be configurable by the operator of the SRP registrar.

	<name>Cleaning Up Stale Data</name>
	<t>Because the DNS&nbhy;SD registration protocol is automatic and not managed by humans,
          some additional bookkeeping is required.  When an update is constructed by the SRP requester,
          it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include an EDNS(0) Update Lease Option <xref target="RFC9664"/>.
          The Update Lease Option contains two lease times: the Lease Time and the KEY
          Lease Time.</t>

	<t>Similar to DHCP leases <xref target="RFC2131"/>,
          these leases are promises from the SRP requester that it will
          send a new update for the service registration before the
          lease time expires.
          The Lease time is chosen to represent the duration after the update
          during which the registered records other than the KEY record
          can be assumed to be valid.
          The KEY lease time represents the duration after the update
          during which the KEY record can be assumed to be valid.
          The reasoning behind the different lease times is discussed in
          <xref target="fcfs"/> and
          <xref target="lifetimes"/>.</t>

          <t>SRP registrars may be configured with limits for these values.
          At the time of writing, a default limit of two hours for
          the Lease and 14 days for the SIG(0) KEY are thought to be good choices.  Devices with limited
          battery that wake infrequently are likely to request longer leases; registrars that support such devices may need to set
          higher limits.  SRP requesters that are going to
          continue to use names on which they hold leases
          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> refresh them well before
          the lease ends in case the registrar is
          temporarily unavailable or under heavy load.</t>

	<t>
	  The lease time applies specifically to the hostname.
	  All service instances, and all service entries for such service
	  instances, depend on the hostname. When the lease on a
	  hostname expires, the hostname and all services that
	  reference it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be removed at the same
	  time: it is never valid for a service instance to remain
	  when the hostname it references has been removed.
	  If the KEY record for the hostname is to remain, the KEY record
	  for any services that reference it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also
	  remain. However, the service PTR record <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be removed since it has no key associated with it and since it is never
	  valid to have a service PTR record for which there is no service instance on the target of the PTR record.
	</t>

	<t>
	  SRP registrars <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also track a lease time per service instance. The reason being that a requester may
	  re-register a hostname with a different set of services and
	  not remember that some different service instance had previously
	  been registered. In this case, when that service instance lease expires, the SRP registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> remove the service
	  instance,
	  and any associated PTR records pointing to that service instance,
	  (although the KEY record for the service instance
	  <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be retained until the
	  KEY lease on that service
	  expires).
	  This is beneficial because it avoids stale services continuing
	  to be advertised after the SRP requester has forgotten about them.
	</t>

	<t>The SRP registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include an EDNS(0) Update Lease option in the
          response.  The requester
          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> check for the EDNS(0) Update Lease option

          lease times from that received option in place of the
          lease times that it originally requested from the registrar.
          The times may be shorter or longer than
          those specified in the SRP Update. The SRP requester must honor them in either case.</t>

<!-- [rfced] In Section 5.1, we see both "N" and "'n'". Please review
     and let us know if/how we may update for uniformity.

Original "N":
   SRP requesters SHOULD assume that each lease ends N seconds after the
   update was first transmitted, where N is the lease duration.

Original "'n'":
   The lease time is never sent as a TTL; its
   sole purpose is to determine when the authoritative DNS server will
   delete stale records.  It is not an error to send a DNS response with
   a TTL of 'n' when the remaining time on the lease is less than 'n'.

[Ted] These are actually two different quantities, but I agree with the correction generally, so have used M for the last paragraph.
-->

	<t>SRP requesters <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> assume that each lease ends N
	seconds after the update was first transmitted (where N is the granted lease
	duration).  SRP registrars <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> assume that each lease
	ends N seconds after the update that was successfully processed was
	received.  Because the registrar will always receive the update after
	the SRP requester sent it, this avoids the possibility of
	a race condition where the SRP registrar prematurely removes
	a service when the SRP requester thinks the lease has not yet expired.
	In addition, the SRP requester MUST begin attempting to renew
	its lease in advance of the expected expiration time, as required
	by the DNS Update Lease specification <xref target="RFC9664"/>,
	to accomodate the situation where the clocks on the SRP requester
	and the SRP registrar to not run at precisely the same rate.</t>

	<t>SRP registrars <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reject updates that do not
	include an EDNS(0) Update Lease option.  DNS authoritative servers
	that allow both SRP and non-SRP DNS updates <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> accept
	updates that don't include leases, but they <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
	differentiate between SRP Updates and other updates and
	<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reject updates that would otherwise be SRP Updates
	if they do not include leases.</t>

	<t>The function of Lease times and the
	function of TTLs are completely different. On an
	authoritative DNS server, the TTL on a resource record is a
	constant. Whenever that RR is served in a DNS response, the TTL value
	sent in the answer is the same.  The lease time is never sent as a
	TTL; its sole purpose is to determine when the authoritative DNS
	server will delete stale records.  It is not an error to send a DNS
	response with a TTL of M when the remaining time on the lease is
	less than M.</t>

	<name>Source Validation</name>
	<t>SRP Updates have no authorization semantics other than
	  "First Come, First Served" (FCFS).
	  Thus, if an attacker from outside the administrative
	  domain of the SRP registrar knows the registrar's IP address, it can, in principle, send updates to the registrar
	  that will be processed successfully.   Therefore, SRP registrars <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be configured to reject updates
	  from source addresses outside of the administrative domain of the registrar.</t>

	<t>For TCP updates, the initial SYN-SYN+ACK handshake prevents
	  updates being forged by an off-path attacker.  In order to
	  ensure that this handshake happens, SRP registrars relying on three-way-handshake validation <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> accept TCP Fast Open payloads
	  <xref target="RFC7413"/>.
	  If the network infrastructure allows it, an SRP registrar
	  <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> accept TCP Fast Open payloads if all such packets
	  are validated along the path, and the network is able to reject this type of spoofing at all ingress points.</t>

	<t>For UDP updates from CNN devices, spoofing would have to be prevented with appropriate source address filtering
	  on routers <xref target="RFC2827"/>.
	  This would ordinarily be accomplished by measures such as those described in
	  Section <xref target="RFC7084" section="4.5" sectionFormat="bare"/>
	  of the IPv6 CE Router Requirements document <xref target="RFC7084"/>.
	  For example, a stub router <xref target="I-D.ietf-snac-simple"/>
	  for a CNN might only accept UDP updates from source addresses known to be on-link on that stub network and might
	  further validate that the UDP update was actually received on the stub network interface and not the interface connected to
	  the adjacent infrastructure link.</t>
      </section>
      <section>
	<name>Other DNS Updates</name>
	<t>Note that these rules only apply to the validation of SRP Updates.
	  An authoritative DNS server that accepts updates from SRP
	  requesters may also accept other DNS Update messages, and those DNS Update messages may be validated
	  using different rules.
	  However, in the case of an authoritative DNS server that accepts SRP
	  updates, the intersection of the SRP Update rules and
	  whatever other update rules are present must be considered very carefully.</t>

	<t>For example, a normal authenticated DNS update to any
	  RR that was added using SRP, but is authenticated using a
	  different key, could be used to override a promise made by the SRP registrar to an SRP requester by replacing all or part of
	  the service registration information with information provided by an authenticated DNS update requester.  An implementation
	  that allows both kinds of updates <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> allow DNS Update requesters that are using different authentication and
	  authorization credentials to update records added by SRP requesters.</t>
      </section>
      <section>
	<name>Risks of Allowing Arbitrary Names to be Registered in SRP Updates</name>
	<t>It is possible to set up SRP Updates for a zone
	  that is also used for non-DNS&nbhy;SD records.
	  For example, imagine that you set
	  up SRP service for example.com.
	  SRP requesters can now register names like "www"
	  or "mail" or "smtp" in this domain. In addition,
	  SRP Updates using FCFS Naming can insert names that are obscene or offensive into the zone. There is no simple solution to
	  these problems. However, we have two recommendations to address this problem:</t>
	<ul spacing="normal">
	  <li>Do not provide SRP service in organization-level zones.
	    Use subdomains of the organizational domain for DNS&nbhy;SD.
	    This does not prevent registering names as mentioned above
	    but does ensure that genuinely important names
	    are not accidentally claimed by SRP requesters.
	    So, for example, the zone "dnssd.example.com" could be used instead of
	    "example.com" for SRP Updates. Because of the way that DNS-browsing domains are discovered, there is no need for the
	    DNS&nbhy;SD discovery zone that is updated by SRP to
	    have a user-friendly or important-sounding name.</li>

	  <li>Configure a dictionary of names that are prohibited. Dictionaries of common obscene and offensive names are no doubt
	    available and can be augmented with a list of typical "special" names like "www", "mail", "smtp", and so on. Lists of
	    names are generally available or can be constructed manually.
	    Names rejected due to this should return a Refused
	    RCODE, indicating to the SRP requester that it
	    should not append or increment a number at the
	    end of the name and try again in an infinite loop.
	    If a name is considered unacceptable because it is
	    obscene or offensive, adding a number on the end is
	    unlikely to make the name become acceptable.</li>

	  potential security exposures and, hence, is not the weak link. This is discussed in more detail in

	<t>The fundamental protection for networks of this type is the user's choice of what devices to add to the network. Work is

	  nor do we specify a mechanism for determining which key to use.</t>

	<t>The current proposed use for "service.arpa" does not require special knowledge on the part of the user. While the
	  "default.service.arpa." subdomain is used as a generic name for registration, users are not expected to see this name in

	  Application software does not need to handle subdomains of "service.arpa" specially.  "service.arpa" <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be treated
	  as more trustworthy than any other insecure DNS domain, simply because it is locally served (or for any other reason). It
	  is not possible to register a PKI certificate for a subdomain of "service.arpa." because it is a locally served domain
	  name. So, no such subdomain can be considered to be uniquely identifying a particular host, as would be required for such a
	  PKI certificate to be issued. If a subdomain of "service.arpa." is returned by an API or entered in an input field of an
	  application, PKI authentication of the endpoint being identified by the name will not be possible. Alternative methods

	<t>One or more IP addresses for recursive resolvers will usually

	<t>A host that is configured to use a resolver other than one that has been provided by the local network may not be able to

	<name>Recursive Resolvers</name>

<!-- [rfced] In the following text, before the two numbered points,
     the text reads "There are three considerations". Should we update
     "three" to "two", or is there another point that the text is
     missing?

Current:
   There are three considerations for caching DNS servers that follow
   this specification:

   1.  For correctness, recursive resolvers at sites using
       'service.arpa.' must, in practice, transparently support DNSSEC
       queries: queries for DNSSEC records and queries with the DNSSEC
       OK (DO) bit set (Section 3.2.1 of [RFC4035]).  DNSSEC validation
       is a Best Current Practice ([RFC9364]): although validation is not
       required, a caching recursive resolver that does not validate
       answers that can be validated may cache invalid data.  In turn,
       this would prevent validating stub resolvers from successfully
       validating answers.  Hence, as a practical matter, recursive
       resolvers at sites using 'service.arpa' should do DNSSEC
       validation.

   2.  Unless configured otherwise, recursive resolvers and DNS proxies
       MUST behave as described in Locally Served Zones (Section 3 of
       [RFC6303]).  That is, queries for 'service.arpa.' and subdomains
       of 'service.arpa.'  MUST NOT be forwarded, with one important
       exception: a query for a DS record with the DO bit set MUST
       return the correct answer for that question, including correct
       information in the authority section that proves that the record
       is nonexistent.

       So, for example, a query for the NS record for 'service.arpa.'
       MUST NOT result in that query being forwarded to an upstream
       cache nor to the authoritative DNS server for '.arpa.'.  However,
       as necessary to provide accurate authority information, a query
       for the DS record MUST result in forwarding whatever queries are
       necessary.  Typically, this will just be a query for the DS
       record since the necessary authority information will be included
       in the authority section of the response if the DO bit is set.

   the approval of IAB, to implement the delegation requested in
   Section 9.

   IANA is further requested to add a new entry to the "Transport-

    <section>
      <name>Using Standard Authoritative DNS Servers Compliant with RFC 2136 to test SRP requesters</name>
      <t>
        For testing it may be useful to set up an
        authoritative DNS server that does not implement SRP.
        This can be done by configuring the
        authoritative DNS server to listen on the anycast address or by
        advertising it in the :_dnssd&nbhy;srp._tcp.&lt;zone&gt;: SRV and
        "_dnssd&nbhy;srp&nbhy;tls._tcp.&lt;zone&gt;" records.
        It must be configured to be authoritative for
        "default.service.arpa" and to accept updates from hosts on local networks for names under "default.service.arpa"
        without authentication since such authoritative DNS servers will not
        have support for FCFS authentication (<xref target="fcfs"/>).</t>
      <t>
        An authoritative DNS server configured in this way will be able to successfully accept and process SRP Updates from requesters that send SRP
        updates.  However, no prerequisites will be applied; this means
        that the test authoritative DNS server will accept internally
        inconsistent SRP Updates and will not stop two SRP Updates sent by different services that claim the same name or names
        from overwriting each other.</t>
      <t>
        Since SRP Updates are signed with keys, validation of the SIG(0) algorithm used by the requester can be done by manually
        installing the requester's public key on the authoritative DNS server
        that will be receiving the updates.  The key can then be used to
        authenticate the SRP Update and can be used as a requirement for the update.  An example configuration for testing SRP
        using BIND 9 is given in <xref target="bind-example"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section>
      <name>How to Allow SRP Requesters to Update Standard Servers Compliant with RFC 2136</name>
      <t>
        Ordinarily, CNN SRP Updates sent to an authoritative DNS server
        that implements standard DNS Update <xref target="RFC2136"/> but not SRP
        will fail
        because the zone being updated is "default.service.arpa" and because
        no authoritative DNS server that is not an SRP registrar would normally
        be configured to be authoritative for "default.service.arpa".
        Therefore, a requester that sends an SRP Update can
        tell that the receiving authoritative DNS server
        does not support SRP but does support
        standard DNS Update <xref target="RFC2136"/>
        because the RCODE will either be NotZone, NotAuth, or Refused or because
        there is no response to the update request (when using the anycast address).</t>
      <t>
        In this case, a requester <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
        attempt to register itself using
        normal DNS updates <xref target="RFC2136"/>.
        To do so, it must discover the
        default registration zone and the authoritative DNS server designated
        to receive updates for that zone, as described earlier, using the
        _dns&nbhy;update._udp SRV record.  It can then send the update to the port and host pointed to by the SRV record, and it is
        expected to use appropriate prerequisites to avoid overwriting competing records.  Such updates are out of scope for SRP,
        and a requester that implements SRP <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
        first attempt to use SRP to register itself and
        only attempt to use backwards capability with
        normal DNS Update <xref target="RFC2136"/>
        if that fails.
        Although the owner name of the SRV record for
        DNS Update (_dns-update._udp) specifies UDP,
        it is also possible to use TCP, and TCP <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be required to prevent spoofing.</t>

<!-- [rfced] We had some questions about abbreviations:

a) Should "DNSSD" (in "non-DNSSD services" and "DNSSD discovery zone")
be updated to "DNS-SD" (hyphen) or "dnssd" (lowercase) to match prior
usage in the document?

[Ted] Yes.

b) Is the "Service" (or "Service Description") redundant here and in
similar cases throughout the document (as SD = Service Discovery)?
That is, just examples below, more cases exist.

Original:
DNS-SD Service registration uses public keys and SIG(0) to allow
services to defend their registrations.

Original:
Although in principle DNS-SD Service Description records can
include other record types with the same Service Instance Name, in
practice they rarely do.

[Ted] No. Do not unpack the acronym! :)

c) For "TSIG", would you like us to expand to "transaction signature"
upon first usage to match RFC 8945?

Original:
   The format of the KEY resource record in the SRP Update is defined in
   [RFC3445].  Because the KEY RR used in TSIG is not a zone-signing
   key, the flags field in the KEY RR MUST be all zeroes.

[Ted] Yikes! This should be SIG(0), not TSIG! That's the name of the protocol, and we've given reference to the correct RFC, so unpacking it would just be confusing.

d) Throughout the document, "SRP Update" is used, and there is only
one instance of "SRV update". We wanted to make sure that "SRV" was
indeed intended and not "SRP".

Original:
   *  If there is one "Add to an RRset" SRV update, there MUST be at
   least one "Add to an RRset" TXT update.

[Ted] This is actually an update to an SRV RR, not an SRP Update, but I agree that it's confusing and have tweaked the text to address the concern.

e) We have updated to use the abbreviation CNN for Constrained-Node
Network (to match its use in RFC 7228).  Please review and let us know
any objections.  Further, please review uses of "constrained network"
and let us know if any of these should be updated to CNN as well.

[Ted] I'm vaguely on the fence about this, but I think consistency is
good, and the term is used enough that using the abbreviation pays off.
-->

<!-- [rfced] We had some questions regarding capitalization of certain terms:


a) We see instances of "Anycast" (capitalized) and "anycast"
(lowercase) throughout the document, but we are unsure if certain
instances are part of proper names while other instances are more
generic. Please let us know if these need to be made more consistent
or if they are accurate as they currently are. We've listed a few
instances below.

Anycast vs. anycast:
   IPv6 Anycast address
   Port Control Protocol anycast address
   fixed anycast address
   anycast address

[Ted] Should be lowercase, I've fixed in the text.

b) We see the following similar terms.  Please review and let us know
if/how to make these terms consistent.

   service instance name
   Service Instance Name
   "Service Instance Name"
[Ted] The above are all the same thing
   service instance
[Ted] This is the data structure (a set of RRs) that the Service Instance Name points to. It's not currently capitalized, and that's probably okay.
   Service Name
[Ted] The Service Name has zero or more PTR RRs each of which has a Service Instance Name as its target. IOW the Service Name is not the same as the Service Instance Name.

c) We see the following similar terms.  Please let us know how to
update for consistency.


BIND 9 vs. BIND9
[Ted] Fixed

d) We have updated the quoted terms that correspond to Sections 2.5.1
- 2.5.4 of RFC 2136 to appear consistently in double quotes and with
capitalization that matches those section titles.  Please let us know
any objections.

[Ted] This seems fine.

We further wondered if the following update should be made:

Original:
The target of the SRV RR Add...

Perhaps:
The "Add To An RRset" SRV update

[Ted] That's indeed confusing, and I've updated the text to make it more clear.

Please review other terms similar to these titles if they exist and
let us know if any further changes should be made.

[Ted] I'm not sure what you're asking here, unfortunately.

e) The NoError status names are in all caps in Section 2.2 of RFC
2136.  Should the following updates be made to match?

ServFail to SERVFAIL
Refused to REFUSED
YXDomain to YXDOMAIN

[Ted] I don't think this is necessary, and would rather we didn't.

f) Regarding the terms “Service Description”, Service Discovery, and
“Host Description”.

- We see both Instruction and instruction when following these terms.
If/How may we make this uniform?

- Should “instruction” or the like should be inserted after instances
of these terms?  Sometimes they are followed by "record" or "update",
if they appear without a label, might this be confusing to the reader?

Example:
   The KEY record in Service Description updates MAY be omitted for
   brevity; if it is omitted, the SRP registrar MUST behave as if the
   same KEY record that is given for the Host Description is also given
   for each Service Description for which no KEY record is provided.

[Ted] Please just leave this text alone. The working group reviewed it and beleives it is correct. Making editorial changes for consistency here might in some cases have merit, but our cache is blown on this work and I do not want to open this can of worms.

g) Please review the following similar terms and let us know if/how
they should be made uniform with regard to quotes and ending with a
period (note that this term would have IANA implications):

"default.service.arpa"
"default.service.arpa."
host.default.service.arpa
host-1.default.service.arpa
host-2.default.service.arpa
host-31773.default.service.arpa. (at end of sentence)
".service.arpa."
"service.arpa"
"service.arpa."

Further note that we have updated from single to double quotes around
terms that were quoted in the original consistently.  Please review
and let us know if further updates are necessary.

[Ted] I've reviewed and don't see any issues.

h) Please review the following for the use of quotes and consistent
use of SRV record.  Please let us know if/how to update.

"_dnssd-srp._tcp.<zone>" SRV record vs.  _dnssd-srp._tcp.<zone> SRV
"_dnssd-srp-tls._tcp.<zone>"  SRV record vs. _dnssd-srp-tls._tcp.<zone> record
_dns-update._udp SRV

[Ted] I've made changes for consistency here. Any inconsistency you still see, e.g. with the zone file, is intentional.

[Ted] These are configuration files. Spacing should not be modified. I don't think there's a need to do anything fancy here. The HTML is currently correct.
